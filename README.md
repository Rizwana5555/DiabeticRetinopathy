This project aims to detect Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a diabetes-related eye disease that can lead to blindness if not diagnosed early. Using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system analyzes retinal fundus images to classify the severity of the disease into five categories: No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative DR. The dataset used is the publicly available APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset from Kaggle, which contains thousands of high-resolution eye images labeled with disease severity levels. Before feeding the images into the model, preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and image enhancement are applied to improve model accuracy and reduce noise.

The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and the entire pipeline—from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation—is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. Various performance metrics such as accuracy and loss are visualized through plots to monitor training progress. The project also supports easy customization and experimentation for further improvements. With its clear structure and practical approach, this project can serve as a foundation for developing real-world medical diagnostic tools or as a learning resource for those exploring deep learning in healthcare.
